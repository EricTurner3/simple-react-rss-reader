# Simple React RSS Reader
![alt text](./images/front_end_20Mar2025.png "React Reader")

## Stack
* frontend - React, TypeScript, Vite
  * `npm run dev` to launch dev mode
* backend (tbd)

## More Information
* Why?
  * Dive into learning a little more about the MEAN/MERN stack and also docker containerization. I used to have my own custom built PHP framework a few years ago and never dove into publically available stacks. This project is to learn how to build a rather simple app and make it easy to launch via docker containers
